    ╔═══╡ Me
    ║ 
    ║  As I have mentioned before, my name is Jaime Portillo, but I am mostly known as Porti.
    ║  I am 22 at the time I am writting this, I am from Madrid, Spain.

    ╠═══╡ Little story 
    ║ 
    ║  My first steps in the software development path were back in 2019 before quarantine, 
    ║  when after one of my teachers noticed that I was interesting in the BATCH terminal recommended me to 
    ║  try learning Python and thats what I did.
    ║ 
    ║ 
    ╠═══╡ The Beggining 
    ║ 
    ║  The quarantine was such an oportinity for me to focus 100% in the new skills I was about to learn with all the whole world that
    ║  programming has, for the next 6 months I was completely focused in learning everything related to programming with Python, until
    ║  at some point I found myself deeply involved in many other fields I was looking forward to explore.
    ║ 
    ║ 
    ╠═══╡ Dive Deep 
    ║ 
    ║  Since then, I expanded my scope to multiple other topics, one of thoose was Cibersecurity. With the help of controled enviorements provided
    ║  by platforms like TryHackMe or HackTheBox but also some other challenges. Along this time I also started to get quite into Operative Systems,
    ║  since it is almost a requirement needed to really get into cibersecurity. The following months I started learning th basics of Linux and BASH,
    ║  along with some basics abow Low-level programming and networking, then headed into the basics of some advanced topics such as 
    ║  Forensics, Criptography, OSINT, Pentesting, ...
    ║ 
    ║ 
    ╠═══╡ Superheroes
    ║ 
    ║  All of this stuff I have learned wouldn't be possible without all of the amazing videos and posts public in the internet. It is amazing all the things you can
    ║  learn from a video on YouTube of some random guy that just decided to create videos for free so anyone can learn complex topics the easiest.

    I use Arch by the way ;)
